# 👋 Hi, I'm Björn Döschl (@doeschbj)

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a research associate at the **Institute of Flight Systems** at the **University of the Bundeswehr Munich**, where I focus on applying intelligence to **unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)**. My work involves building a **holistic planning and execution framework** for UAVs, with both **simulated and real-world testing environments**. I'm especially passionate about **autonomous swarm systems**, exploring both **centralized** and **decentralized intelligence** in multi-agent settings.

## 🌟 Interests

- Autonomous UAVs & Swarm Intelligence  
- Planning & Execution Architectures  
- Reinforcement Learning & Machine Learning  
- Simulation & Real-time Systems


## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced topics in **Machine Learning** and **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**
- **ROS2**, **PX4**, and **UAV communication protocols**
- Scalable software architectures for robotic systems
